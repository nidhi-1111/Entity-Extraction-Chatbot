            "answer": "The KeelWings program for recent graduates, offers practical experience to add to resumes as a job. Similar to KeelWings, the KeelMate program enables those with experience to level up to a role that is more sustaining. All who desire it receive resume and portfolio support. The overwhelming majority leave KeelWorks for better pay. The KeelMaster program is in development to support the most challenged unemployed and underemployed with barrier identification and mitigation, core competency training, and extended community support leaning to stable and sustaining employment. All KeelWorks programs are virtual, meaning that we bring our support to where those in need are."

            "question": "Why should I care about KeelWorks and its mission?",
            "answer": "We believe everyone can be successfully employed and that helping them helps all of us. Even without compassion for those who struggle, it is clear that helping the disengaged to engage brings solutions we did not have and reduces the burden on social systems."

            "question": "How does helping KeelWorks benefit society?",
            "answer": "Getting the idle to work is the gift that keeps on giving. They help their family, their community, and their nation. When a person goes to work, they transition from dependent to contributor - those who can\u2019t see the human side, can look to the tax burden."
